### This guide is an intro to Rust syntax. It doesn't touch on concepts at all.

### Concepts are more important, but sometimes you need a little boost to get to a point where the concepts make sense.

### This is that boost.

## install rust

The best way to install Rust is with [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). rustup is a Rust
version manager. To install it type:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

To keep your rust up-to-date with the latest stable version of rust,
type:

```
rustup update
```

To check which version of Rust you have type:

```
rustc -- version
```

## setting up a project

There are many ways to setup a project in Rust, but this is the simplest.

1. Create a repository on Github
2. Clone the repository
3. `cd` into the repository directory
4. Type `cargo init .`

This will create several files and folders for you automatically:

- `Cargo.toml`: metadata about your project and it's dependencies
- `.gitignore`: ignores compiled files built by Rust
- `src/lib.rs`: where your Rust code goes (change this to `main.rs` if you are not writing a library)

## setting up a project

#### `lib.rs` vs `main.rs`

There are 2 main types of projects you can make in Rust. A library and not
a library. 

If you are writing a <strong>library</strong>, it means you intend for your
code to be used in someone else's application as a crate or module.
If you want to do this, you should use a `lib.rs`.

If you are writing a <strong>not library</strong>, it means that you'd like
to write code that compiles into a binary that someone can run. If you 
want to do this, you need to use a `main.rs`. Inside the `main.rs` you 
should have a `main` function that looks like this:

```rust
fn main() {
  /// your app code goes here
}
```

## cargo

Cargo is a tool that helps you develop Rust. It does several things:

- Runs tasks: `cargo build` (compile your app), `cargo test` (test your app), `cargo run` (run your app)
- Start a project: `cargo new`, `cargo init`

Officially, Cargo is the package manager for Rust. This means that you can
use Cargo to install and manage bits of other people's code.

- A package in Rust is called a Crate.
- You can find Crates on http://crates.io
- You list the Crates you want to use in the `Cargo.toml` file
- You app keeps track of what crates you are using in the `Cargo.lock` file

## storing values

To get started using Rust you'll probably want to assign values so that
you can use them. To do this in Rust:

```
let name = "ashley";
let age = 30;
```

If you want to make a constant, you must specify a type:

```
const FAVENUM: u32 = 6;
```
---

## types

There are a lot of types, but just to get you started:

- `u32`: unsigned 32-bit integer
- `i32`: signed 32-bit integer
- `String` and/or `&str`: more on these below
- `bool`: a boolean

## dealing with strings

String in Rust are a lot more complicated than you might be used to if
you are coming from another language, in particular, interpreted languages
like Ruby or JavaScript. Here's some key points:

#### `&str` and `String`
- "my string" is not a `String`. it's a `str`. the difference between the a `String` and a
  `str` is how they are allocated. don't worry about that right now.
- pretty much always use `str` with an `&`, as `&str`.
- You can turn a `&str` into a `String` by using `to_string()` or `String::from()`. You want
  to do this because String has a ton of awesome convenience methods.

## concatentation

- add a `&str` to a `String` using `push_str()`

```rust
let realstring = String::from("hello ");
let str1 = "world!"
let message = realstring.push_str(str1);
```

- add `&str`s using `format!`

```rust
let str1 = "hello ";
let str2 = "world!"
let message = format!("{}{}", str1, str2);
```

## characters

- a `char` is a different type than a `str` or `String`. `char` is always single quotes.
- to get a `String`'s `char`s you can call `chars()`
- you might find that instead of `chars()` you really want `as_bytes()` but if you aren't sure
  don't sweat it rn

Example:

```rust
let letters = String::from("ashley").chars();

for l in letters {
  /// do something cool with characters
}
```

## macros

Macros are an interesting part of Rust. You know something is a macro if it has
a `!`. The least technical way to describe the cool thing about Macros is that they
kinda get compiled twice. Don't worry if that doesn't make any sense.

- `println!` is the equivalent of `console.log` or `puts`. It prints printable things
  to standard output, which is usually just the console.

```rust
println!("i get printed on the screen");
println!("hello {}!", "world");
```

- `format!` is also a macro. We talked about it before as a way to build `str`s out of
  `str`s. 

```rust
format!("my dogs are named: {} and {}", "cheeto", "frito");
```

## function signatures

```rust
pub fn say_hello(name: &str) -> &str {
  let message = format!("hello, {}!", name);
  message
}
```

- put `pub` at the beginning if you want the function to be accessible outside the file
  as in a module or crate
- the keyword `fn` is how we know it is a function
- list parameters inside the parans in the style `parameter_name: Type`, separate by commas
- use the `->` to say what type the function returns
- return a value from the last line of a function by omitting the semicolon
- return early in a function using the `return` keyword

## `match` syntax

Rust has pattern matching and it's great!

```rust
match animal {
  "cat" => "Meow",
  "dog" => "Woof",
  _ => "<indeciperable>", /// trailing comma!
}
```

- `_` is used as a catch-all for anything that doesn't match
- `match` supports trailing commas, and it's best practice to use them :)

## the `Option` type

Rust doesn't have `nil`/`null` so if you want to express that something might return
something or nothing, you need to use the `Option` type.

To write the `Option` type, write the word `Option`, followed by angle brackets with
a Type inside, e.g. `Option<u32>`.

For example, if a parameter is optional you'd write:

```rust
fn greeting(name: Option<&str>) -> &str {
  let who = match name {
    Some(n) => n,
    None => "World",
  }
  format!("Hello, {}!", who)
}
greeting(Some("ashley"));
/// "Hello, ashley!"
greeting(None);
/// "Hello, World!"
```

## the `Result` type

`Result` is kind of like `Option` except instead of something or nothing, you
expect something that is Ok(`Ok()`) or an error(`Err()`).

To write the `Result` type, write the word `Result`, follow by angle brackets with
a Type and an Error Type inside, e.g. `Result<u32, &'static str>`.

For example:

```rust
fn parse_name(name: &str) -> Result<&str, &'static str> {
  match name {
    Some(n) => Ok(n),
    None => Err("You must provide a name."),
  }
}
```

## testing

Rust has unit testing built in! You can write tests in their own file, or right
inline with your code.

To designate a test write `#[test]` above a code block with asserts:

```rust
fn say_hello(name: &str) -> &str {
  let who = match name {
    Some(n) => n,
    None => "World",
  }
  format!("Hello, {}!", who)
}

#[test]
fn it_should_say_hello() {
  assert_eq!(say_hello(), "Hello, World!");
  assert_ne!(say_hello("ashley"), "Hello, World!");
  assert_eq!(say_hello("ashley"), "Hello, ashley!");
}
```
